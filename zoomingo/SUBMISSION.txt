b. First I would like to add more rules in win, like sqrt amount of cards need to be selected at one row, colume 
or all different which can be adapted what we learn in SET hw. Then, some player has same name, so we need a special id
for each player like let them enter their account instead of name. Because of the final week, I have few time to add 
additional functionality, but I hope I can make it better one day! Thanks for whole quarter! Best Regards!
